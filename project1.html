            textbook.</a><br>
        <br>
        Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about <i> Introduction to Algorithms:</i> <br>
        <br>
        <i>Will there be a fourth edition? If so, when will it be available? </i>
        <dd>
            We are currently working on the fourth edition. No public release date has been set. If you're wondering
            whether to hold off buying the third edition in anticipation of the fourth edition, I advise you not to
            wait.
        </dd><br>
        <br>

        <i>Where is the website for the book?</i>
        <dd>The MIT Press site is <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition"></a>
            http://mitpress.mit.edu/content/algorithms.</dd>
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Where can I find a list of a errata?</i>
        <dd>We maintain an <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php"> errata page</a> that
            allows you to list errors by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer. There is even an incremental
            update feature, allowing you to list only the errors posted since the last date that you asked about.</dd>
        <br>
        <br>

        <i>
            How do I report errors?
        </i>
        <dd>
            First, please visit the <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page </a>
            to verify that the error has not been reported already. Once you have determined that you have found an
            unreported error, send email to <a style="color: rgb(86, 69, 136);"
                href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu.">clrs-bugs@mit.edu.</a> We will respond
            as quickly as possible, often within a day.
        </dd> <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            Do you correct errors?
        </i>

        <dd>
            Yes. Each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by
            that time. The<a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a>indicates in
            which printing each error was corrected.
        </dd> <br>
        <br>
        <dd>
            Because we are intensively working on the fourth edition, I am no longer posting errors in the third
            edition.
        </dd> <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            What is the difference between an edition and a printing?
        </i>
        <dd>
            Each edition is a major revision of the book. The first edition of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> was
            published in 1990, the second edition came out in 2001, and the third edition appeared in 2009. A printing
            for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to manufacture more copies. As the answer to the
            previous question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each printing of the second and third
            editions. We perturb the pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a new printing.
        </dd> <br>
        <br>
        <i>
            Can I get solutions to exercises and problems?
        </i>
        <dd>
            As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for a select set of exercises and problems. They
            are posted at the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition"> MIT Press
                website</a>.

        </dd> <br>
        <br>
        <dd>
            We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the
            book for course use. The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by
            no means all of them. (I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take
            somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.) You'll need to contact the MIT
            Press for passwords to access the manual site and the files. (Contact information is at the <a
                href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition">MIT Press website</a> .) You
            cannot
            get the passwords from me or from any of my coauthors.

            I created two packages for LaTeX2e. The <code>clrscode</code> &&nbsp; package gives you pseudocode in the

            the

        I was <a href="https://www.kcbs.us/">Kansas City Barbeque Society</a> Certified Barbeque Judge number 62145. (I
        have purposely let my KCBS
        membership lapse.) My first contest as a certified judge was the 2011 Maryland State Championship in Bel Air.
        <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/images/Judging%20chicken.JPG">Here </a> is a photo of me just
        starting to judge the first item, chicken. And <a
            href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/images/After%20judging.JPG">here</a> is a photo after judging five
        entries each of chicken, pork ribs, pork, and beef brisket. (Photos courtesy of Craig Ward, a.k.a. "Mr. Time To
        Go," a.k.a. "Large And In Charge," the contest organizer.)

        In September 1997, Nicole and I finished hiking all 48 of the 4000-foot peaks in the <a
            href="http://hikethewhites.com/">White Mountains</a> of New
        Hampshire.
